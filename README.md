# The Cashier Problem
Create a program that helps a cashier give adequate change to customers. The program should return the amount of notes and coins for the customer's change.
Example: If the price is €3.75 and the paid amount is €50, then the client should receive €46.25 back in change.
* The expected output should be:
* 2 x €20 // 2 twenty euro notes
* 1 x €5 // 1 five euro note
* 1 x €1 // 1 euro
* 1 x €0.2 // 1 twenty cent coin
* 1 x €0.05 // 1 five cent coin
Example: Price: €4.50, Paid amount: €20, Change: 15.50
* Expected output:
* 1 x €10
* 1 x €5
* 1 x €0.5
* Notes
* Include outputs for exceptions e.g. price: €4, paid amount: €3.
